# IoT-based-ECG-Heart rate monitoring-system

In this project, IoT Based ECG and Heart rate Monitoring, We will learn how to monitor Heart and ECG rates with AD8232 ECG Sensor and ESP8266(nodemcu). We will also learn to plot the ECG graph online on any IoT cloud platform . To accomplish this, we will connect the AD8232 ECG Sensor to the ESP8266. Then, by connecting ECG leads to the chest or hand, we will generate an ECG signal. We will send the ECG graph to the cloud using MQTT Broker using Ubidots parameters such as API Key or Token.Heart disease has become a major concern in recent decades, and many people have died as a result of various health issues. As a result, heart disease should not be taken lightly. This disease can be avoided by analyzing or monitoring the ECG signal early on. As a result, we present this project IoT Based ECG and heart rate Monitoring with AD8232 ECG Sensor and Arduino.

Connect the OUTPUT to analog A0 of Nodemcu. Connect the LO+ & LO- to D5 & D6 of NodeMCU respectively. Supply the AD8232 kit with 3.3V VCC & Connect its GND to GND.


It is recommended to snap the sensor pads on the leads before application to the body. The closer to the heart the pads are, the better the measurement. The cables are color coded to help identify proper placement.

Once the code is upload, open the Serial Monitor and Set the Buad Rate to 9600. The ECG waveform can be seen below as a visualiations effect on Serial Monitor.
